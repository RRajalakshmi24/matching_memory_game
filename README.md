How to Play
The game consists of a deck of cards with different icons on them.

The deck is shuffled and the cards are placed face down.

The player must select two cards to reveal their icons.

If the icons match, the cards remain face up and the player earns a point.

If the icons do not match, the cards are turned face down again.

The game continues until all the cards have been matched.

The player wins if all the cards have been matched and loses if the timer runs out.
